# FlyoutPanel - How to navigate between buttons by using a keyboard


<strong>FlyoutPanel</strong> can show buttons if the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressUtilsFlyoutPanelButtonOptions_ShowButtonPaneltopic">FlyoutPanel.OptionsButtonPanel.ShowButtonPanel</a> option is enabled. It is possible to click a button only by using the mouse. Sometimes, it is comfortable to highlight a particular button and navigate between the buttons by using a keyboard. This example illustrates how to implement this feature. To highlight the first button, press the <strong>ALT</strong> key. Once it is done, it is possible to navigate between buttons by using the arrow keys. <br><br><br>
